MoodNail is an interactive web application I created to help users pick the perfect nail colour based on weather, mood, and event context. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project gave me hands-on experience in desktop app development by integrating the app with Electron JS. It also strengthened my skills in JavaScript event handling, allowing me to create a dynamic and responsive user interface that reacts smoothly to user inputs.
